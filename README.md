## Vue Weather App

This is a simple Vue.js application that displays the current weather conditions for a given city. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data.

### Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamzachenguiti/vue-weather-app.git
cd vue-weather-app
npm install
```

### Running the App

To run the app, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server on port 3000. You can then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app.
